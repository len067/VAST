# An ASKAP Survey for Variables and Slow Transients (VAST)
A database of information on each VAST observation and the resulting data products.
This consists of a set of plain text files formatted as "comma-separated-values" (csv). The primary file is `field_data.csv`.
* Each row (line) of the primary file corresponds to an observation; multiple observations of a single field each have their own row.
* To each row there correspond several auxiliary files:
 	* beam information files: beam_inf_[SB]-[fld].csv
 	* sources matched to catalogue [cat] cat_match_[cat]_[SB]_[fld].csv
 	* PSF variation over field as images --- psf.bma.SB[SB].[fld].fits, psf.bmi.SB[SB].[fld].fits, psf.bpa.SB[SB].[fld].fits

NOTE epochs prior to epoch 75 have now been archived such that most csv files are now compressed into tarballs (tgz).

## <a name="database"></a>1.0 The database
The elements of the database are evident on this repository page. To use the database take the following steps:
1. If you have not used git, configure it with
```
$ git config --global user.name "Your Name"
$ git config --global user.email "your_name@some_email"

```
2. Clone the database on your computer
```
$ cd your-directory
$ git clone ssh://git@bitbucket.csiro.au:7999/askap_surveys/vast.git
```
Once finished you will find 
```
.
+-- your-directory/
|  +-- vast/
|  |  +-- db/
|  |  +-- db-inputs/
|
```

3. To be consistent with usage in this document which uses `$SURVEY` to refer to the database: 
```
$ export SURVEY=your-directory/vast
```

* **MinUV** Minimum length of baselines used to form image (metres).

## <a name="axiliary"></a>3.0 Auxiliary files
Auxiliary files, both `.csv' and `'.fits', are named according to the SBID and FIELD_NAME of the observation, the combination of which is always unique. CSV files are named as `X_SBID_FIELD.csv` where _X_ denotes the variety of file. At present, possible values of _X_ are 'astrom_bb', 'beam_inf' and 'cat_match'.  FITS files are named as `X.SBID.FIELD.fits` where _X_ is one of 'psf.bma', 'psf.bmi', 'psf.bpa'.

### <a name="astro-bb"></a>3.1 Astrometry beam-to-beam `astrom_bb_sb-fld.csv`
For some observation the database includes an _astrom_bb_ file. For each pair of adjacent beams isolated point sources present in both members of the pair were identified. The _astrom_bb_ table lists the mean astrometric differences over these sources, and their standard deviations; both resolved into _x_ and _y_ (&#945; cos(&#948;), &#948;), and given in arcseconds
#### Data columns
* **BEAM1** First beam of pair
* **BEAM2** Second beam of pair
* **DX_MEAN** Mean astrometric difference in &#945; cos(&#948;)
* **DX_STD** Standard deviation astrometric difference in &#945; cos(&#948;)
* **DY_MEAN** Mean astrometric difference in &#948;
* **DY_STD** Standard deviation astrometric difference in &#948;

* **BEAM_NUM** Beam number - 0-based
* **BEAM_TIME** Time stamp of beam image
* **RA_DEG** Right Ascension of field centre in decimal degrees
* **DEC_DEG**  Declination of field centre in decimal degrees
* **GAL_LONG** Galactic longitude in decimal degrees

* **VIS_FLAGGED** Number of visibilitiees flagged

### <a name="cat"></a>3.3 Source matching `cat_match_cat_sb-fld.csv`
For each of SUMSS, NVSS, TGSS and ICRF, sources in the VAST mosaic selavy output were matched with catalogued sources. VAST sources were drawn from the Selavy file and chosen according to the selection criteria held in the file `$SURVEY/db-inputs/match_params.txt`. Sources were matched if their positions were found within the tolerance set in match_params.txt, typically 10 arceconds. The `cat_match` csv files has a row for each matched source, with columns as listed below.

* **Component_ID** Identifier given by Selavy
* **RA** Component Right Ascension in decimal degrees
* **DEC** Component Declination in decimal degrees
* **RACS_flux** Component total flux-density (mJy)
* **RA_comp** Comparison catalogue component Right Ascension in decimal degrees
* **DEC_comp** Comparison catalogue component Declination in decimal degrees
* **Comp_flux** Comparison catalogue component total flux-density (mJy)
* **Flux_Ratio_AlphaCorr** Flux density ratio corrected for an assumed spectral index given as `alpha` in `match_params.txt`
* **Flux_Ratio_NOAlphaCorr** Flux density ratio, unchanged.
